# Flash sort
Flash sort is a distribution sorting algorithm. It has a usual performance of O(n) for uniformly distributed data sets. It has relatively less memory requirement.

The basic idea behind flashsort is that in a data set with a known distribution, it is easy to immediately estimate where an element should be placed after sorting when the range of the set is known.
