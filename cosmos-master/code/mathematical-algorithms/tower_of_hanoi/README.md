This problem is done using recurssive approach.
Moving n disks from rod L to rod R using rod C, can be recurssively defined as:
1.) Moving n-1 disks from rod L to rod C.
2.) Moving nth disk from rod L to rod R.
3.) Moving n-1 disks from rod C to rod R.

The recussion stops when n becomes 1 which is just moving a particular disk.
