# Union Find
Description
---
In computer science, a disjoint-set data structure, also called a union–find data structure or merge–find set, is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It provides near-constant-time operations (bounded by the inverse Ackermann function) to add new sets, to merge existing sets, and to determine whether elements are in the same set. In addition to many other uses (see the Applications section), disjoint-sets play a key role in Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

Functions

- connect()
--Connects two components.
- areConnected()
--Returns true if the two vertices are in the same component.
