# Binary search
The binary search algorithm is used for finding an element in a sorted array. It has the average performance O(log n).

## Procedure
1. Find middle element of the array.
2. Compare the value of the middle element with the target value.
3. If they match, it is returned. 
4. If the value is less or greater than the target, the search continues in the lower or upper half of the array.  
5. The same procedure as in step 2-4 continues, but with a smaller part of the array. This continues until the target element is found or until there are no elements left.
