When the term algorithm is used in math, it typically refers to a set of steps used to solve a mathematical computation.
2sum:-AVL tree is taken and addition of node is performed.
Check in square:-check in square is performed in various languages like C,SCALA,JAVA etc.
Polynomial:an expression of more than two algebraic terms, especially the sum of several terms that contain different powers of the same variable(s).
in this polynomial operation is performed in C.
Amicable number:-Amicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. (A proper divisor of a number is a positive factor of that number other than the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.)
in this amicable number code is designed in different languages.
Armstrong number:-An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3 = 371. Write a program to find all Armstrong number in the range of 0 and 999.
Automorphic numbers:-In mathematics an automorphic number (sometimes referred to as a circular number) is a number whose square "ends" in the same digits as the number itself.
babylonian method:-The Babylonian method for finding square roots involves dividing and averaging, over and over, to obtain a more accurate solution with each repeat of the process. Step 2: Divide your original number by your guess. Step 3: Find the average of these numbers. Step 4: Use this average as your next guess.
