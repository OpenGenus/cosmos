# Interval Scheduling
Interval Scheduling is a problem where we have multiple jobs which can overlap all with weight 1, and we want to find a schedule such that was spend the most time doing work. This is a greedy algorithm which choses based on finish time.

## Complexity
The space complexity is O(N) and the time complexity is O(N)
