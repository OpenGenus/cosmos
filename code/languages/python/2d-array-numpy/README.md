# 2D Arrays in NumPy

## [Article for 2D arrays in Python using Numpy](https://iq.opengenus.org/2d-array-in-numpy)

Array is a Linear Datastructure which consists of list of elements. Arrays can be 1 Dimensional, 2 Dimensional, 3 Dimensional and so on. 2 Dimensional arrays are often called as Matrix.<br>

Arrays created  with NumPy are stored in contiguous memory locations so it leds to faster operations on it. It is more efficient as compared to traditional arrays and Lists. 

This article covers various topics such as :
* Introduction and Installation of NumPy
* What is an Array?
* Creating an Array
* Various funtion on Array
* Indexing
* Initialization
* Operations on 2D array
* Reorganizing arrays

This article will give you the basic knowledge of Numpy and 2D arrays. The code for it can be found in 2D-array-numpy.py file.
