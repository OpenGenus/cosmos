An **Array** is a continuous memory allocation of the group of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name. In this article, we have focused on **2D array in Java** which is a variant of the usual 1D array by introducing a new dimension.

In short, it is defined as:

```java
int[][] arr = new int[10][20];
```



There are mainly two common variations of Arrays, namely :

- 1-D Array (or commonly called Array)
- Multidimensional Arrays

2-D Array is the simplest form of a Multidimensional array. Now, we are going to explore 2-D arrays in a greater detail.
