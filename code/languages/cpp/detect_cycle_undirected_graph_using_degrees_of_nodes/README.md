**Detect cycle in a graph using degree of nodes of the graph**

There are different ways to detect cycle in an undirected graph. This article explains an intuitive and simple approach to detect cycle
and print the nodes forming the cycle in the graph.
We make use of :
* Map to maintain the adjacency list
* Queue to store all nodes/vertices with degree 1
* Boolean Array to keep track of the visited vertices
