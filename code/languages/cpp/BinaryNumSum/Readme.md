                          ADDING TWO BINARY NUMBERS

We are given two binary numbers of 'N' bits, we need to give an Binary Number as the output that would be the sum of the both the given numbers.

Firstly, the program asks the user to input the number of bits, the binary number is of. Then it takes binary numbers as Input one by one and stores them in two different arrays. Don't forget to give a space between each bit of binary numbers. Then we have a nested loop, having the basic binary sum algorithms, which displays the output.
