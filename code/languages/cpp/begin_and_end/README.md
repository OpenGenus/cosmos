**array::begin()** function is a library function of array and it is used to get the first element of the array, it returns an iterator pointing to the first element of the array.

Here, it's the syntax:
```cpp 
array::begin();
```


**array::end()** function is a library function of array and it is used to get the last element of the array, it returns an iterator pointing to the last element of the array.

Here, it's the syntax:
```cpp
array::end();
```
Both the function returns iterator-

**Iterators** are used to point at the memory addresses of STL container and used to traverse a container like array and to access its elements.They reduce the complexity and execution time of program.

In this article, we'll get more information about begin() and end() function of an array and the basic idea about the iterators as well.
