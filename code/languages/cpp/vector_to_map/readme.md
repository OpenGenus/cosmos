An approach to find different ways to convert vector to map in C++.


Maps are a part of the C++ Standard Template Library
maps are used to replicate associative arrays.
maps contains sorted key-value pair , in which each key is unique and cannot be changed and it can be inserted or deleted but cannot be altered.
Each element has a key value and a mapped value. No two mapped values can have same key values.
Maps store the key values in ascending order by default

Vectors are part of the C++ Standard Template Library. vector can provide memory flexibility.
vector being a dynamic array, doesn't need size during declaration
vectors are like arrays that are used to store elements of similar data types. However, unlike arrays, the size of a vector can grow dynamically.
i.e we can change the size of the vector during the execution of a program as per our requirements.
The vector class provides various methods to perform different operations on vectors.


Vector of maps can be used to design complex and efficient data structures.
