### Task 1

Write dart code of a program that reads two numbers from the user, and prints their sum, product, and difference.

==========================================================

*hint: Subtract the second number from the first one*

==========================================================

**Example01:**

Input:\
 4\
 5

Output:\
Sum = 9\
Product = 20\
Difference = -1

Input:\
 30\
 2

Output:\
Sum = 32\
Product = 60\
Difference = 28

-44

Output:\
The number is even
