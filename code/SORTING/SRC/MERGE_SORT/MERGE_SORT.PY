# Split array in half, sort the 2 halves and merge them.
# When merging we pick the smallest element in the array.
# The "edge" case is when one of the arrays has no elements in it
# To avoid checking and breaking the look, finding which array has elements and then
# Starting another loop, we simply alias the arrays. This abstracts the issue without 
# Creating a mess of code. When we alias, we decide with Xor which array to pick,
# Since we cover 0 ^ 0 case in the beginning of the loop,
# while bool(a) or bool(b) makes 0^0 is impossible to happen, Xor has 3 cases, 1 ^ 0, 0 ^ 1, 1^1 to evaluate. 
# Since the 2 first cases are the edge we go inside the loop and alias the array that has elements in it. 
# If it's 1^1 we simply pick the array with the smallest element.
