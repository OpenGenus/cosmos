Your personal library of every design pattern code that you will ever encounter

Opposed to the OOP design patterns, functional design patterns could be replaced by one single word: functions.
Everything in functional programming is about functions and laws.
Most FP design patterns follow these "patterns":
1. a set of laws that need to be met in order for some functions to be applied over some data
2. a set of functions that need to be implemented according to the user specific data

Generally, one would desire for these patterns to be designed shapelessly ( using generics ).
In order for that to be succesfully done, the language of choice generally has to support generics and higher-kinded types.
