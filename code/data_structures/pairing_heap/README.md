# Pairing heap

A pairing heap is a heap structure, which is simple to implement in functional languages, and which provides good amortized performance.

## Operations

- merge - &Theta;(1) - Merges two heaps
- insert - &Theta;(1) - Inserts an element into a heap
- findMin - &Theta;(1) - Returns the minimal element from the heap
- deleteMin - O(log n) - Deletes the minimal element from the heap
