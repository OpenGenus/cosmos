Description
---
A [binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) is a variation of the [tree](..) data structure, the change being that each node can have a maximum of two children. It is useful for performing [binary searches](../../../search/binary_search), or generating [binary heaps](../../heap) to prepare for [sorting](../../../sorting).
