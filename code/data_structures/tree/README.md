# Tree

Description
---
A tree is a data structure that is comprised of various **nodes**. Each node has at least one parent node, and can have multiple child nodes. The only node that does not have a parent node is a unique node called the **root**, or sometimes base node. If a node has no children, it can be called a **leaf**.
