# Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
A Union Find data structure(also called disjoint-set) is a data structure that keeps track of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint(non-overlapping) subsets.
It provides near-constant-time operations to add new sets, to merge existing sets, and to determine whether elements are in the same set.
