# Binary Search Tree

Description
---
Binary Search Tree is basically a binary tree which has the following properties:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values **lesser** than the node’s value.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with value **greater** than the node’s value.
* The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

Operations performed on binary search tree are:
1. Insertion
2. Deletion
3. Searching

Traversals of a Binary Search tree:

* Inorder:    `Left, Root, Right`
* Preorder:   `Root, Left, Right`
* Postorder:  `Left, Right, Root`<br>

Note: In Binary Search Tree inorder traversal gives the sorted order of the elements in BST.
