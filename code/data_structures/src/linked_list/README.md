# Linked Lists

## Description

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.
In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) or pointer to the next node in the list.

## Functions

- insert()
--Inserts a new element into list.
- delete()
--Deletes an element into list.
- search()
--searches for a particular element in the list.

## Time Complexity

- Insertion : O(1)
- Deletion  : O(1)
- Access    : O(n)
- Search    : O(n)
