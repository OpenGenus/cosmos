# Binary Search Java Program

This repository contains a Java program that implements the Binary Search algorithm, along with variations for specific scenarios. The Binary Search algorithm is an efficient searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays. This program provides additional functionality and variations of Binary Search to handle different use cases.

## Variations

The program includes the following variations of the Binary Search algorithm:
- Binary Search in a 2D Array: With this variant, you can quickly locate the target element by conducting a binary search on a two-dimensional array.
- Binary Search in an Infinite Array: This variant shows how to conduct a binary search on an infinite array, where the array's size is unknown. It employs an expanding window technique to locate the desired element.
- Ceiling Value in Array: Using the Binary Search algorithm, this variation locates the smallest element in the array that is greater than or equal to the target value.
- Floor Value of Array: In this variation, the Binary Search algorithm is used to locate the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to the target value.
