The C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
Stls are very time saving when we are using CPP as they can be easily operable and quick to work.

These are the STLs that would be very helpful for you.
1)Vector
2)Set
3)Multiset
4)Map
5)Multimap
6)unordered_set (Introduced in C++11)
7)unordered_multiset (Introduced in C++11)
8)unordered_map (Introduced in C++11)
9)unordered_multimap (Introduced in C++11)


You can get the syntax of all the STls in the respective folders.
