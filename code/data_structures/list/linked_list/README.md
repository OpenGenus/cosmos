# Linked List

A linked list is a data structure containing a series of data that's linked together. Each node of a linked list contains a piece of data and a link to the next node, as shown in the diagram below:

## Types of Linked Lists

There are several types of linked lists. The most common ones are:

### Singly linked list

The simplest type. Each node has a data field and a link to the next node, with the last node's link being empty or pointing to `null`.

### Double linked list

Each node of a doubly linked list contains, in addition to the data field and a link to the next code, a link to the previous node.

## Circularly linked list

A singly linked list, except that the last item links back to the first item, as opposed to a singly linked list which links to nothing or `null`.
