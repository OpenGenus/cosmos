# Backtracking

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons each partial candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

This folder contains solutions in separate folders to various backtracking problems, such as Algorithm X, Knight Tour, N Queens Problem, etc. Each folder has its own README that explains the problem and the algorithm used to solve it.
