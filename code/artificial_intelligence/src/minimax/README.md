# Minimax Algorithm

According to wikipedia , Minimax is a "decision rule used in decision theory, game theory, statistics and philosophy for
minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario." Put forward in simpler words, it is an algorithm 
which is generally used to analyze games mathematically and to find  optimal moves for a player so that if the player takes
those moves , he/she is likely to win the game , given that the other player also plays optimally(does not make mistakes).
It is used widely in 2 player turn taking games such as tic-tac-toe , chess , etc.
