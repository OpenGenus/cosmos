SVMs attempt to split labelled data into groups. A simple linear SVM can split data into known labelled groups - a line separating a plane (2 dimensions),
a plane separating 3 dimensions, hyperplane of data with even more dimensions (inputs). SVMs are much faster than more complicated artificial intellegence data structures like neural nets, and can learn nonlinear separations through use of a Kernel function.

For a super simple example using the [Scikit-learn library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html), see scikit_svm.py.
