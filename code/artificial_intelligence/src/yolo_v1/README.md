# YOLO 
YOLO, abbreviated from You Only Look Once is an mult-object detection CNN architecture developed by Joseph Redmon, Santosh Divvala, Ross Girshick and Ali Farhadi. You can find more about it on [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640)
I have implemented the same algorithm using Pytorch.

# Required Packages
1. pytorch
2. torch vision
3. pandas
4. numpy
5. PIL
6. matplotlib
Rest of them are common python libraries

# Steps for replication
1. Downloading this jupyter notebook on Google Colab. Alternatively, they can also load the dataset to their own computers instead of using Google Drive or Kaggle (as done in this notebook).
2. Running all the cells **sequentially** in the order as in the notebook.
3. It's done! You can go ahead and try the same algorithm on different datasets.
