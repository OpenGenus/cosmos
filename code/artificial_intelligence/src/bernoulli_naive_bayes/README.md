Bernoulli Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm and is one of the three variants of Naive Bayes. Bernoulli Naive bayes classifier uses bernoulli distribution for the classification. 

The article in the OpenGenus discusses about Bernoulli Naive Bayes in Detail. 
It covers:
1. Brief introduction about Naive Byaes
2. Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Beroulli distribution
3. Algorithm and steps on how to solve it manually
4. Detailed python code for Bernoulli Naive Bayes
