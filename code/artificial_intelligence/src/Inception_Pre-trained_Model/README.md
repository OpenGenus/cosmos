This  article at opengenus  about the Inception Pre-Trained cnn model gives an entire overview of the following :

* Inception model
* It's architecture
* The various versions of this model
* Their evolution history

The Inception model , introduced in 2014, is a deep CNN architecture. It has also  won  the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC14). These networks are useful in computer vision and  tasks where convolutional filters are used.

Heretofore, inception has evolved through its four versions namely, **Inception v1** ,**Inception v2 and v3**, **Inception v4 and Resnet**.
These versions have showed iterative improvement over each other which has helped in pushing its speed and accuracy.

All of these, along with their architectures, have been discussed in detail in the above article.
