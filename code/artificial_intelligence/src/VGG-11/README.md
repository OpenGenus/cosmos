The article at OpenGenus elaborted about VGG-11, its architecture, number of layers it comprise of along with its application and importnance.

It is a pre-trained model, on a dataset and contains the weights that represent the features of whichever dataset it was trained on. 
VGG-11, it attributes to 11 weighted layers, Weights represent the strength of connections between units
in adjacent network layers,are used to connect the each neurons in one layer to the every neurons in the next layer,
weights near zero mean changing this input will not change the output.

VGG incorporates 1x1 convolutional layers to make the decision function more non-linear without changing the receptive fields.
Labeled as deep CNN, VGG surpasses datasets outside of ImageNet.
The architecture of VGG-11 and the ctivation functions insight to different applications and importance whose 
detialed account has ben provided.
