## A Beginner's roadmap to mastering Machine Learning 
---
I decided to collect resources and concentrate them to form a basic roadmap, to help other beginners like myself, who would like to explore the field further and not feel lost.

### Topics touched in the post:
  * Introduction to my background to give you an idea.
  * Why ML?
  * Essentials to get an extensive insight into machine learning.
  * "What is ML" and surrounding misconceptions. 
  * A basic roadmap I devised, for anybody who wishes to pursue this art further. 

### Gist of the roadmap:
  1. Learn and/or revise Math.
  2. Learn Python.
  3. Get acquainted to Python libraries.
  4. Code, code, and code.
