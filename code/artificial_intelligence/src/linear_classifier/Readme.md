# Linear Classifier

Fist of all we define classification as dividing the input variable x into different classes (generally two classes: +1 and -1).

Let t = +1↔ x assigned to Class 1
t = −1↔ x assigned to Class 2

Linear models for classification separate input vectors into classes using linear (hyperplane) decision boundaries.


# Example 

y (x) = wx + b

y (x) ≥ 0 → x assigned to C 1
y (x) < 0 → x assigned to C 2

Thus y (x) = 0 defines the decision boundary
