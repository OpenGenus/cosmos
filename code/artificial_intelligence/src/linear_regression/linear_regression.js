* Description: Multivariate linear regression that uses the normal equation
* as an optimizer. The normal equation is fine to use
* when n, the number of features being worked with, is
* less than 10,000. Beyond that, it is best to use
* other methods like gradient descent.

* Requirements:
* - mathjs (install using npm)
