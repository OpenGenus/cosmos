# Linear Regression

The **linear regression** is a statistical approach for modelling relationship between a dependent variable with a given set of independent variables.

In order to provide a basic understanding of linear regression, we start with the most basic version of linear regression, i.e. Simple linear regression.

Simple Linear Regression
------------------------

Simple linear regression is an approach for predicting a response using a single feature.

It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related. Hence, we try to find a linear function that predicts the response value(y) as accurately as possible as a function of the feature or independent variable(x).

Multiple linear regression
--------------------------

Multiple linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two or more features and a response by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

Clearly, it is nothing but an extension of Simple linear regression.

Applications
------------

1. Trend lines: A trend line represents the variation in some quantitative data with passage of time (like GDP, oil prices, etc.). These trends usually follow a linear relationship. Hence, linear regression can be applied to predict future values. However, this method suffers from a lack of scientific validity in cases where other potential changes can affect the data.

2. Economics: Linear regression is the predominant empirical tool in economics. For example, it is used to predict consumption spending, fixed investment spending, inventory investment, purchases of a countryâ€™s exports, spending on imports, the demand to hold liquid assets, labor demand, and labor supply.

3. Finance: Capital price asset model uses linear regression to analyze and quantify the systematic risks of an investment.

4. Biology: Linear regression is used to model causal relationships between parameters in biological systems.
