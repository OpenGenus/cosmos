# Tower of Hanoi

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

* Only one disk can be moved at a time.	
* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a     disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack
* No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk
