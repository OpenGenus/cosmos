# Fifteen Puzzle

The 15-puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen, Mystic Square and many others) is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. 

The puzzle also exists in other sizes, particularly the smaller 8-puzzle. 

If the size is 3×3 tiles, the puzzle is called the 8-puzzle or 9-puzzle, and if 4×4 tiles, the puzzle is called the 15-puzzle or 16-puzzle named, respectively, for the number of tiles and the number of spaces. 

**The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.**
