b# Play Fair Cipher

Play Fair Cipher comes under a Substitution cipher's category and this cipher was the first practical digraph substitution cipher. In play fair cipher unlike traditional cipher, we encrypt a pair/digraph of alphabets (digraphs) instead of a single alphabet.

## Working Play Fair

There are few steps which we have to follow during Encryption and Decryption. They are:

And for forming Di-graphs, we have different rules for encrytion and decryption. All those rules and proper explanation is mention in this [Article](https://iq.opengenus.org/play-fair-cipher/).

> **Step-1:** Generating Key Matrix (Same for Encryption/Decryption)
> This step is same for both encrytion and decryption.

> **Step-2:** (Encrytion) Encrypt the Plain Text from Key Matrix to Cipher/Encrypted Text.

> **Step-3:** (Decrytion) Decrypt the Cipher Text from Key Matrix to Plain Text.
