# Huffman Encoding

Huffman Encoding is a famous greedy algorithm that is used for the loseless compression of file/data. It uses variable length encoding where variable length codes are assigned to all the characters depending on how frequently they occur in the given text. The character which occurs most frequently gets the smallest code and the character which occurs least frequently gets the largest code.
