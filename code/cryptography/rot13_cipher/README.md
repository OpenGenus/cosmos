# ROT-13 Cipher

ROT-13 is a simple substitution cipher in which each letter is shifted by 13 letters in the alphabet, wrapping around when neccesary. An example is shown below:

## ROT-N

ROT-N, more commonly known as a Caesar cipher, is similar to ROT-13, although letters can be shifted by any number of spaces. This makes ROT-13 a subset of a Caesar cipher where letters are shifted by 13 spaces.
