# Chinese cipher
from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_cipher#Transposition_ciphers

In the Chinese cipher's method of transposing, the letters of the message are written from right to left, down and up columns to scramble the letters. Then, starting in the first row, the letters are taken in order to get the new ciphertext. For example, if the message needed to be enciphered was THE DOG RAN FAR, the Chinese cipher would look like this:

                           R R G T
                           A A O H
                           F N D E
                           
The cipher text then reads: RRGT AAOH FNDE
