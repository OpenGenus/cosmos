Securing the Internet presents great challenges and research opportunities. Potential applications such as Internet voting, universally available medical records, and ubiquitous e-commerce are all being hindered because of serious security and privacy concerns. The epidemic of hacker attacks on personal computers and web sites only highlights the inherent vulnerability of the current computer and network infrastructure. 

> This is where Cryptographic algorithms step in. 

Cryptographic algorithms are designed around the idea of _computational hardness assumptions_, making such algorithms hard to break in practice. It is theoretically possible to break such a system but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means. These schemes are therefore termed **computationally secure** such as improvements in integer factorization algorithms, and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted. There exist information-theoretically secure schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power—an example is the one-time pad—but these schemes are more difficult to implement than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms.
