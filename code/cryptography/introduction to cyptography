Basically ,cryptography is used to protect digital data.it is a vision of computer science that focuses on transforming data into formats that 
cannot be recognised by unauthorized users.An example of basic cryptography is encrypted message in which letters are replaced with other characters.
cryptography is all about maths,builds from the fields of pure maths known as Number theory which deals with integers,it is all about encryption algorithm..public encryption is implemented through RSA cyptosystem.
