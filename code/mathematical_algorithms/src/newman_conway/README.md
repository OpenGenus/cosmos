# Newman-Conway Sequence 
The recursive sequence defined by its recurrence relation

## Explaination

### Recurrence Relation
`P(1) = 1,`  
`P(2) = 1,`  
`P(n) = P (P(n-1) ) + P( n - P(n-1) )`  

### Pattern
1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, ...

## Complexity
To compute n<sup>th</sup> Newman-Conway Number.  
`Time Complexity: O(n)`

`Space Complexity: O(n)`
