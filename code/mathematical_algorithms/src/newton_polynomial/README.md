# Newton Polynomial

Okay. More information in this: [Newton Polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_polynomial)

We release it with help divided differences. To verify the correct values, we set in x the difference between the first and second. For example:

1

2

3

4

Set in x = 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and in result we must get a cube of these values. Also, divided difference is here: [Click me](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/tree/master/code/mathematical-algorithms/divided_differences) However you can implement the divided differences in your own way.
