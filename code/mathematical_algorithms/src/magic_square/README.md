# Magic Square

## Explanation

A magic square is an nxn (i.e, square) matrix of numbers containing all numbers from 1 to n2 such that all the numbers in any given row, column, or main diagonal sum to the same number. The number n is called the order of the magic square.

The constant sum in every row, column and diagonal is called the magic constant or magic sum, M. The magic constant of a normal magic square depends only on n and has the following value:
`M = n(n^2+1)/2`

## Complexity

O(n^2) as every position is visited once and there are n^2 elements.
