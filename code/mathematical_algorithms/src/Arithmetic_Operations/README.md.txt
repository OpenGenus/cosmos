# Implementation of various Arithmetic operations in c++ 
Perform operation on two operands according to the user's choice. 

The algorithm for same can be devised as:
1. Input the two operands
2. choice=y
3. Initiate do-while loop (choice=='y' || choice=='Y')
4.   input ch
5.   switch case according to ch
6.   input choice
7. End loop;
