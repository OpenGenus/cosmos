# Cellular Automata

Cellular automata consist of grid whose cells can have a specified amount of different states. For every cell in a state a neighborhood is defined.

The next state of a cell is determined by a specific ruleset which assigns the next state according to the current state and the neighbors states.

## States

The simplest set of states is that a cell can either be inactive (0) or active (1). This is used in popular cellular automata like for example Conway's Game of Life.

However more than two states are possible. For example normally Langton's Ant only uses two states but it can be easily extended to have more than two states which then leads to different behaviors of the automaton.

## Neighborhoods

In two dimensional cellular automata with a square grid there are two main kinds of neighborhood: Moore neighborhood and von Neumann neighborhood

* Moore neighborhood
means that all cells surrounding a cell are considered its neighbors. This neighborhood is for example used in Conway's Game of Life.
* von Neumann neighborhood
defines the neighborhood of a cell only as those cells directly adjacent to it.

## Classification

According to Stephen Wolfram cellular automata can be classified in 4 classes according to their complexity.
