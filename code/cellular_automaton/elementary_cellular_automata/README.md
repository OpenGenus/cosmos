# Elementary Cellular Automata

Elementary cellular automata are the simplest cellular automata. They use a 1-dimensional grid (one row of cells) with 2 possible states.

Every cell has two neighbors which means that the next state of a specific cell is determined by the states of three cells (the cell's state itself and the state of its neighbors).
This leads to the fact that there are exactly 8 (2^3) possible combinations. A rule for an elementary cellular automaton therefore has to define the next state for each of these 8 combinations.
This allows for 256 (2^8) different rules ([Visualization](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cellular-automata/supplement.html)).
