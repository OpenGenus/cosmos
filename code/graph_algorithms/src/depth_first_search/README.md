Traversal means visiting all the nodes of a graph. Depth first traversal or Depth first Search is a recursive algorithm for searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure.

The DFS algorithm works as follows:

Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack.
Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.
Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of stack.
Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.
