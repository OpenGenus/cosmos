## Breadth First Search

Breadth first search algorithm is used for traversing from a selected node and it traverses the graph layerwise and explores the neighbor nodes first before moving to next level of neighbors.

### Pseudocode
```c
BFS(G,s) //Here G is graph and s is sourcenode.
   Let q be queue
       q.enqueue(s)
   mark source node (s) as visited
   while(q is not empty)
       u = q.dequeue
       for all neighbors of v of u in graph G,
               if v is not visited 
                     q.enqueue(v)
                     mark v as visited
```
