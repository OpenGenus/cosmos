# Breadth First Search Algorithm (BFS)
In this algorithm, we search for a target node among the neighbouring nodes at a level in the graph before moving to next level.
Thus, it is also called as level order traversal algorithm.

It is similar to the BFS algorithm for a tree. However, it is possible to have cycles in a graph.
Hence, we have to keep track of the visited nodes.
