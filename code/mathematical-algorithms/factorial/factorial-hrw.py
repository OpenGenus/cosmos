#	This is my way of calculating factorial, i call it the half reverse way, first you divide the number you want it's factorial
#	then you multiply every number until it's half counting up with every number until it's half counting down then
#	you multiply all of the multiplication results together and then multiply the result by 2, and there you have it,
#	a fast fun way to calculate factorial.

for i in range(1,halfF):
	j=factorial-i
	s=j*i
	m.append(s)
	print(i,"*",j,"=",s)
