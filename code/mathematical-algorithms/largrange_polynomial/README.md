# Lagrange Polynomial

More information in this: [Lagrange Polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial)


Set in x = 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and in result we must get a cube of these values. This method is an analogue of Newton's polynomial. The output values are equal. [Newton Polynomial is here](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/tree/master/code/mathematical-algorithms/newton_polynomial)
