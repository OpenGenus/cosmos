## Collatz Conjecture ##
In the field of mathematics the collatz conjecture was posed by L. Collatz in 1937 which states that given a number n, one can  always
'get to one' by applying the following function recursively on the number.

### Function for Collatz Conjecture ###

1. **If number is even ** :<br />
    number = number / 2

2. **If number is odd ** :<br />
    number = (3 * number) + 1
