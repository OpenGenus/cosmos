# Automorphic Number
In mathematics an automorphic number (sometimes referred to as a circular number) is a number whose square "ends" 
in the same digits as the number itself. For example, 
+ 5<sup>2</sup> = 2**5**
+ 6<sup>2</sup> = 3**6**
+ 76<sup>2</sup> = 57**76**
+ 376<sup>2</sup> = 141**376**
+ 890625<sup>2</sup> = 793212**890625**

So 5, 6, 76, 376 and 890625 are automorphic numbers.
