# Depth-First Search (DFS) 

is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph or tree data structure by visiting as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. It's called "depth-first" because it explores as deeply as possible along each branch before moving to a sibling branch. DFS can be implemented using both iterative and recursive methods. It is a fundamental algorithm for many graph-related tasks, including searching for paths, determining connectivity, and exploring tree structures.
