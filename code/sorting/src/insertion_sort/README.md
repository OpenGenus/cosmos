# Insertion Sort
Insertion sort iterates through an array, taking one input element at each iteration, and grows a sorted output. With each iteration, insertion sorts removes the element at the current index, finds the removed elements position in the sorted output list, and inserts it there. This is repeated until no elements remain.

## Algorithm
1. Get unsorted array/list
2. Set 'marker' for sorted section after first element in array/list
3. Select first unsorted number
4. Swap number with left elements until it is in correct position in sorted sub-array
5. Move sorted section marker over to the right one position
6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 until no more elements exist in unsorted sub-array.


## Complexity
**Time Complexity:**
- Worst case: **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**
- Average: **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**
- Best case: **O(n)**

**Space Complexity:**
- Average: **O(n)**
