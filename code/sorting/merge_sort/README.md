# Merge Sort
The merge sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. It has a usual performance of O(n log n).

This algorithm works by dividing the unsorted list into n sublists; each one containing one element (which
is considered sorted, since it only has one element).

Then it merges the sublists to produce new sorted sublists, this is repeated until there's only one sublist remaining, which is the resulting sorted list.
