# Jaccard Similarity Coefficient #

The Jaccard similarity coefficient is a statistic used for comparing the similarity and diversity of sample sets.
The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between finite sample sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection
divided by the size of the union of the sample sets:-

(If A and B are both empty, we define J(A,B) = 1.)

 Note that 0 ≤ J ( A , B ) ≤ 1.
