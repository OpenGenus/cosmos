# Heap Sort

Heap sort is a comparison based sorting algorithm. There are two main parts to the process.
* A heap is built from the unsorted data. The algorithm separates the unsorted data from the sorted data.
* The largest element from the unsorted data is moved into an array

Heap Sort uses a heap to sort the given elements. It is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that runs in O(n log n).

## Procedure
1. Build a heap with the elements you want to sort.
2. Extract the elements from the heap one by one and put them in the sorted elements vector.
