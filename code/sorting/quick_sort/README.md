# Quick Sort
The Quicksort is a comparison sort algorithm. It has an average performance of O(n*log(n)).

## Procedure
1. Choose an element from the array : the pivot
2. Partition the array into sub-arrays :
    - elements with lower values than the pivot
    - elements with greater values than the pivot
3. Apply recursively the 2nd Step on all partitions
