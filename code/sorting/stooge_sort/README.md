# Stooge-sort

Inspired by the three stooges smashing each other in the head with a wooden plank.

## Algorithm

* If the value at the start is larger than the value at the end, swap them.
* If there are 3 or more elements in the list, then:
* Stooge sort the initial 2/3 of the list
* Stooge sort the final 2/3 of the list
* Stooge sort the initial 2/3 of the list again
