# Longest Arithmetatic Progression

## Description

Find longest Arithmetic Progression in an integer array A of size N, and return its length. More formally, find longest sequence of indices, 0 < i1 < i2 < … < ik < ArraySize(0-indexed) such that sequence A[i1], A[i2], …, A[ik] is an Arithmetic Progression.
