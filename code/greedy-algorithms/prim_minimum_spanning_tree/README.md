# Prim's Minimum-Spanning-Tree





<br>
* * *
The use of the heap data structure gives Prim's algorithm an `O(mlogn)` running time, where m is the number of edges and n is the number of vertices.

The MST algorithm expects an adjacency list. That list should be a dictionary where for every vertex v and every edge(v,w) with weight j and an identifier eID, there is an entry in that dictionary such that v is the key, and its value is a list of all tuples (w,j,eID). The algorithm returns a set containing the edge ids of all the edges in the MST.
