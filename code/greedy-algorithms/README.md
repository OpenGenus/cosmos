# Greedy algorithms

A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time.

In the words of _Jessica Su_, we have:

A greedy algorithm finds the best solution to a problem one step at a time.  At each step, the algorithm makes the choice that improves the solution the most, even if that choice makes future steps less fruitful.  Sometimes this gives you the right answer to the problem.

Examples:
* Let's say you're at a restaurant and have ordered several dishes.  When each dish comes out, you can choose to eat some of it, or save your stomach for the next dish.
Suppose the first dish that comes out is mediocre.  A smart person would save their stomach, since they'd rather fill up on better food.  But a greedy person would eat a lot of it, because that maximizes their happiness in the moment.

* Suppose you're out hiking, and you want to climb to the top of the tallest mountain, but you don't know where it is.  The greedy way to find it would be to start walking in the direction that slopes upward the most, and keep doing this until you reach a peak.  (It probably won't be the tallest peak, but that's why greedy algorithms don't work here.)
