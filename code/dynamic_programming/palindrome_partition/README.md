## Palindrome Partitioning

### Problem Statement

```
Given a string `s`, determine the minimum number of cuts necessary to partition `s` in a set of palindromes. 

For example, for string `aaabbba`, minimum cuts needed is `1`, making `aa | abba`.

Expected time complexity: `O(n^2)`, where n is the size of string `√ès`
