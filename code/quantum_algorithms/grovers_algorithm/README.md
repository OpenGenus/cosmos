# Grover’s Algorithm
## Detailed Resources to Understand the Algorithm:-
+ [Quantum Computing Resources](https://www.topcoder.com/quantum-computing-for-beginners-what-you-need-to-know) - For Beginners
+ [Topcoder's Tutorial on Grover's Algorithm](https://www.topcoder.com/grovers-algorithm-in-quantum-computing)
+ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm) - For complete details of this algorithm

## Complexity:-
The time complexity for Grover's Searching Algo is **O(sqrt(N))** where, N is the number of element in the set that is to be searched.
