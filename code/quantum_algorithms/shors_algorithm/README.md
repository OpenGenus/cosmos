# Shor’s Algorithm
## Detailed Resources to Understand the Algorithm:-
+ [Quantum Computing Resources](https://www.topcoder.com/quantum-computing-for-beginners-what-you-need-to-know) - For Beginners
+ [Topcoder's Tutorial on Shor's Algorithm](https://www.topcoder.com/shors-algorithm-in-quantum-computing)
+ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm) - For complete details of this algorithm

## Basic Info:-
Shor’s algorithm was invented by Peter Shor for integer factorization in 1994. It finds the prime factors of an integer N.  Quantum Fourier Transform is the basis of the algorithm which finds the period of the function which gives the value based on the product of the prime factors.
## Complexity:-
Shor’s algorithm executes in polynomial time of O(log N) on a Quantum Computer and O((log N)3) on Classical Computers.
