# Leap year
The aim is to find leap years between two given years which are taken as input from the user.

Leap year is a year that contains 366 days.

"A leap year (also known as an intercalary year or bissextile year) is a calendar year containing one additional day (or, in the case of lunisolar calendars, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical or seasonal year."

To calculate which years will be leap years there are some conditions:

-if a year is divisible by 4 and is not divisible by 100; 
-or;
-if a year is divisible by 400;
-then this year is a leap year;
