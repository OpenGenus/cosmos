# What is A Krishnamurthy number?

It's a number whose sum total of the factorials of each digit is equal to the number itself.


## Here's what I mean by that:

### "145" is a **Krishnamurthy** Number because,
#### 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145

### "40585" is also a **Krishnamurthy** Number.
#### 4! + 0! + 5! + 8! + 5! = 40585

### "357" or "25965" is **NOT a Krishnamurthy** Number
#### 3! + 5! + 7! = 6 + 120 + 5040 != 357
