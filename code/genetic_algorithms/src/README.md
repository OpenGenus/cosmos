A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by **Charles Darwin's** theory of natural evolution, a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms.
These are intelligent exploitation of random search provided with historical data to direct the search into the region of better performance in solution space. They are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions for optimization problems and search problems.

Genetic algorithms are based on an analogy with genetic structure and behavior of chromosome of the population. Following is the foundation of GAs based on this analogy –

* Individual in population compete for resources and mate.
* Those individuals who are successful (fittest) then mate to create more offspring than others.
* Genes from “fittest” parent propagate throughout the generation, that is sometimes parents create offspring which is better than either parent.
* Thus each successive generation is more suited for their environment.
