### Make

An automation tool predominantly used to compile and construct the binary executable files from a complex source code involving multiple imports and libraries.

### Makefile

* The “Make” command uses this “Makefile” to know the steps to build the binaries from the source code.
* By default, the “Make” command searches for a file named “Makefile” if the “Makefile” is not explicitly specified. At most places, the “Makefile” will be given the same name.
