## Description

A linked list is said to contain a cycle if any node is visited more than once while traversing the list.

Complete the function provided for you in your editor. It has one parameter: a pointer to a Node object named head that points to the head of a linked list. Your function must return a boolean denoting whether or not there is a cycle in the list. If there is a cycle, return true; otherwise, return false.

Note: If the list is empty, head will be null.
