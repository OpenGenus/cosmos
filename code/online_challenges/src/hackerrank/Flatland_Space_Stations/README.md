# Description
Flatland is a country with a number of cities, some of which have space stations. Cities are numbered consecutively and each has a road of 1km length connecting it to the next city. It is not a circular route, so the first city doesn't connect with the last city. Determine the maximum distance from any city to it's nearest space station.

For example, there are n = 3 cities and m = 1 of them has a space station, city 1. They occur consecutively along a route. City 2 is 2 - 1 = 1 unit away and city 3 is 3 - 1 = 2 units away. City 1 is 0 units from its nearest space station as one is located there. The maximum distance is 2.
