# Description
Little Bobby loves chocolate. He frequently goes to his favorite 5 & 10 store, Penny Auntie, to buy them. They are having a promotion at Penny Auntie. If Bobby saves enough wrappers, he can turn them in for a free chocolate.

For example, Bobby has n = 15 to spend on bars of chocolate that cost c = 3 each. He can turn in m = 2 wrappers to receive another bar. Initially, he buys 5 bars and has 5 wrappers after eating them. He turns in 4 of them, leaving him with 1, for 2 more bars. After eating those two, he has 2 wrappers, turns in 2 leaving him with 1 wrapper and his new bar. Once he eats that one, he has 1 wrappers and turns them in for another bar. After eating that one, he only has  wrapper, and his feast ends. Overall, he has eaten 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 9 bars.
