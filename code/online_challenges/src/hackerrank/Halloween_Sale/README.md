# Description
You wish to buy video games from the famous online video game store Mist.

Usually, all games are sold at the same price, p dollars. However, they are planning to have the seasonal Halloween Sale next month in which you can buy games at a cheaper price. Specifically, the first game you buy during the sale will be sold at p dollars, but every subsequent game you buy will be sold at exactly d dollars less than the cost of the previous one you bought. This will continue until the cost becomes less than or equal to m dollars, after which every game you buy will cost m dollars each.

For example, if p = 20, d = 3 and m = 6, then the following are the costs of the first 11 games you buy, in order:
                     20, 17, 14, 11, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6
You have s dollars in your Mist wallet. How many games can you buy during the Halloween Sale?
