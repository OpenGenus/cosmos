Given an unsorted array of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2, …N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.

Note: If you find multiple answers then print the Smallest number found. Also, expected solution is O(n) time and constant extra space.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of array. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.

Output:
Print B, the repeating number followed by A which is missing in a single line.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ N

Example:
Input:
2
2
2 2
3 
1 3 3

Output:
2 1
3 2

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Repeating number is 2 and smallest positive missing number is 1.
Testcase 2: Repeating number is 3 and smallest positive missing number is 2.
