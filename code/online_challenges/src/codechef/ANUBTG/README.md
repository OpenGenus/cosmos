# Description
It is winter super sale and all the shops have various offers. Suraj selected N items to buy and he is standing in the billing queue. It was then he noticed the offer "Buy two, get two". That means for every two items you buy, they give you two items for free. However, items can be of varying price, they always charge for 2 most costly items and give other 2 as free. For example, if the items cost 1, 1, 2, 2, then you have to pay 4 and take all 4 items.

Suraj is busy reordering his items to reduce the total price he has to pay. He can separate the items and get them on different bills if needed. Can you tell me what is the least price Suraj has to pay to buy all the N items?
