Problem Statement:Shirin and her sister Doodi visited a mall to buy some shoes , but seeing a sale they got excited and brought N shoes so that they can distribute it among their K friends.

You can give any friend a pair of shoes if both the shoes are of the same type. A valid distribution is when no friend has 2 pairs of the same type. You can not give any of your friend's a single shoe.

You are given a string of length N where each character indicates a type of shoe , can you help them find out whether they can distribute all the shoes among their friends or not.
