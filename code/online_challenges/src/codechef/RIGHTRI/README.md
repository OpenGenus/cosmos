# Description
The Chef is given a list of N triangles. Each triangle is identfied by the coordinates of its three corners in the 2-D cartesian plane. His job is to figure out how many of the given triangles are right triangles. A right triangle is a triangle in which one angle is a 90 degree angle. The vertices of the triangles have integer coordinates and all the triangles given are valid( three points aren't colinear ).
