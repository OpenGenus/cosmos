# Description
In an attempt to control the rise in population, Archer was asked to come up with a plan. This time he is targeting marriages. Archer, being as intelligent as he is, came up with the following plan:

A man with name M is allowed to marry a woman with name W, only if M is a subsequence of W or W is a subsequence of M.

A is said to be a subsequence of B, if A can be obtained by deleting some elements of B without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Your task is to determine whether a couple is allowed to marry or not, according to Archer's rule.
