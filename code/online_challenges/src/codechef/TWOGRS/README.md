Problem Statement:Consider a multiset S which contains A copies of the integer 1, B copies of 2 and C copies of 3. For example, if A=3, B=3 and C=3, then S={1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3}.

Your goal is to divide the elements of S into two groups (multisets); each element of S must be in exactly one of these groups and the sum of elements of one group must be equal to the sum of elements of the other group. In our example, it is possible to make the groups {1,1,2,2,3} and {1,2,3,3}; the sum of elements of each group is 9.

Determine if it is possible to make such groups.
