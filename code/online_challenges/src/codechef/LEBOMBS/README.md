# Description
The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv currently is on the military mission. There are N enemy buildings placed in a row and numbered from left to right strating from 0. Each building i (except the first and the last) has exactly two adjacent buildings with indices i-1 and i+1. The first and the last buildings have just a single adjacent building.

Some of the buildings contain bombs. When bomb explodes in some building it destroys it and all adjacent to it buildings.

You are given the string S of length N, where Si is 1 if the i-th building contains bomb, 0 otherwise. Find for the Little Elephant the number of buildings that will not be destroyed after all bombs explode. Please note that all bombs explode simultaneously.
