# Description

You are Dastan, the great Prince of Persia!

After searching long for the mysterious 'Sands of Time', you have finally arrived at the gates of the city that hosts the ancient temple of the gods. However, the gate is locked and it can only be opened with a secret code, which you need to obtain by solving the following puzzle:

There is a table in front of you, with NN coins placed in a row and numbered 11 through NN from left to right. For each coin, you know whether it is initially showing heads or tails. You have to perform exactly KK operations. In one operation, you should remove the rightmost coin present on the table, and if this coin was showing heads right before it was removed, then you should also flip all the remaining coins. (If a coin was showing heads, then after it is flipped, it is showing tails, and vice versa.)

The code needed to enter the temple is the number of coins which, after these KK operations are performed, have not been removed and are showing heads. Can you find this number? The fate of Persia lies in your handsâ€¦
