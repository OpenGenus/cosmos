# Description

All submissions for this problem are available.The Students of Tritvi College are shifting to their new hostels at Sabar

Since Sabar
is a little far away from GEC where they usually go for studying, and Infocity, where they go for shopping; they decide that in order to visit all of them in a single day, they would first go to GEC from Sabar and then later, from GEC to Infocity and then back to Sabar from Infocity


The students know the distance a
between GEC and Infocity, and the distance b between Infocity and Sabar. Help them find the maximum possible distance c and the minimum possible distance d between Sabar and GEC

when it is known that all the three destinations do not lie on a single straight road.
Input:

    The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, a
and b

### Output:

    For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers, c and d

### Constraints

    0≤T≤10^6
    1≤a,b≤10^6
