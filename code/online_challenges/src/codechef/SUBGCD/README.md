# Description
Given an array A1,A2...AN, you have to print the size of the largest contiguous subarray such that GCD of all integers in that subarray is 1.
Formally,
For a subarray Ai,Ai+1...Aj where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N to be valid: GCD(Ai,Ai+1...Aj) should be 1. You have to print the size of the largest valid subarray.

If no valid subarray exists, output -1.

Note:A single element is not considered as a subarray according to the definition of this problem.
