# Description
Little Elephant was fond of inventing new games. After a lot of research, Little Elephant came to know that most of the animals in the forest were showing less interest to play the multi-player games.Little Elephant had started to invent single player games, and succeeded in inventing the new single player game named COIN FLIP.

In this game the player will use N coins numbered from 1 to N, and all the coins will be facing in "Same direction" (Either Head or Tail),which will be decided by the player before starting of the game.

The player needs to play N rounds.In the k-th round the player will flip the face of the all coins whose number is less than or equal to k. That is, the face of coin i will be reversed, from Head to Tail, or, from Tail to Head, for i â‰¤ k.

Elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing a particular face after playing N rounds. Elephant really becomes quite fond of this game COIN FLIP, so Elephant plays G times. Please help the Elephant to find out the answer.
