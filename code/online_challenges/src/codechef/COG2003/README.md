Problem Statement:"An apple a day keeps the doctor away" is a common English-language proverb of Welsh origin. There is no scientific evidence that eating an apple a day has any significant health effect but our beloved Baba believes it.

Few days ago Baba has distributed apples among N children. i-th child got ai apples from Baba. Now Baba is eager to know who will be healthy for the longest duration (according to the above described proverb). He is a little busy nowadays so he asks you to determine the number of apples one got from Baba who will be healthier for the longest duration.

Note: One must eat only one apple a day. 
No two children got the same number of apples.
