# Description

Chef has a string S with length N. He needs to find the number of indices i (1≤i≤N−1) such that the i-th character of this string is a consonant and the i+1

-th character is a vowel. However, he is busy, so he asks for your help.

Note: The letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' are vowels; all other lowercase English letters are consonants.
### Input

    The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
    The description of T test cases follows.
    The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
    The second line contains a single string S with length N


### Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of occurrences of a vowel immediately after a consonant.
Constraints
