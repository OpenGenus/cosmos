# Documentation Guide

## README Template

When you are adding a new folder for a new Project Euler problem, add a README.md in the folder with the following format:

```Markdown

# Project Euler Problem #NUM: Title of Problem

([Problem Link](<- Is alt text. This is the actual Link to  the problem))

Problem text copy/pasted exactly as it is from official website.
If there is center alignment, or formatting in the original question, then update as equivalent here.
