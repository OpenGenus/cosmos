# Project Euler Problem #067: Maximum path sum II

([Problem Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=67))

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

```
   3
 
  7 4
 
 2 4 6
 
8 5 9 3
```
That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom in [triangle.txt](https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p067_triangle.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.
