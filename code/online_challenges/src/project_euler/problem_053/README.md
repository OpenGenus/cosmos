# Project Euler Problem #53: Permuted multiples

([Problem Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=53))

There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345  

In combinatorics, we use the notation, <sup>5</sup>C<sub>3</sub> = 10.

In general,

<sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub> = n! / ()r!(n−r)!), where r ≤ n, n! = n×(n−1)×...×3×2×1, and 0! = 1.
It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: <sup>23</sup>C<sub>10</sub> = 1144066.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of  <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub>, for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, are greater than one-million?
