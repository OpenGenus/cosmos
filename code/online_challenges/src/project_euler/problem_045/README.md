# Project Euler Problem #45: Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal

([Problem Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=45))

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle	 	T<sub>n</sub>=n(n+1)/2	 	1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...  
Pentagonal	 	P<sub>n</sub>=n(3n−1)/2	 	1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...  
Hexagonal	 	H<sub>n</sub>=n(2n−1)	 	1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...  

It can be verified that T<sub>285</sub> = P<sub>165</sub> = H<sub>143</sub> = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
