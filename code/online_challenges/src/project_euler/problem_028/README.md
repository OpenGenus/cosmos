# Project Euler Problem #028: Number spiral diagonals

([Problem Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=28))

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

<p align="center">
<pre>
21 22 23 24 25
20  7  8  9 10
19  6  1  2 11
18  5  4  3 12
17 16 15 14 13
</pre>
</p>

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
