# Project Euler Problem #037: Truncatable Primes  

([Problem Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=37))

The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and   
remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.  

Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.  

NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.
