# Project Euler Problem #42: Coded triangle numbers

([Problem Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=42))

The n<sup>th</sup> term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, t<sub>n</sub> = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t<sub>10</sub>. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using [words.txt](https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p042_words.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?
