# Project Euler Problem #034: Digit factorials  

([Problem Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=34))  

145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.
