# Project Euler Problem #41: Pandigital prime

([Problem Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=41))

We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime.

What is the largest n-digit pandigital prime that exists?
