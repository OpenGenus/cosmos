# Project Euler Problem #19: Counting Sundays

([Problem Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=19))

You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

* 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
* Thirty days has September,
April, June and November.
All the rest have thirty-one,
Saving February alone,
Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
And on leap years, twenty-nine.
* A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
