# Project Euler Problem #39: Integer right triangles

([Problem Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=39))

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
