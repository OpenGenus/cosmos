# Project Euler Problem #43: Coded triangle numbers

([Problem Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=43))

The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.

Let d<sub>1</sub> be the 1<sup>st</sup> digit, d<sub>2</sub> be the 2<sup>nd</sup> digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following:

* d<sub>2</sub>d<sub>3</sub>d<sub>4</sub>=406 is divisible by 2
* d<sub>3</sub>d<sub>4</sub>d<sub>5</sub>=063 is divisible by 3
* d<sub>4</sub>d<sub>5</sub>d<sub>6</sub>=635 is divisible by 5
* d<sub>5</sub>d<sub>6</sub>d<sub>7</sub>=357 is divisible by 7
* d<sub>6</sub>d<sub>7</sub>d<sub>8</sub>=572 is divisible by 11
* d<sub>7</sub>d<sub>8</sub>d<sub>9</sub>=728 is divisible by 13
* d<sub>8</sub>d<sub>9</sub>d<sub>10</sub>=289 is divisible by 17  
Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property.
