# Project Euler

From [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/):

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

This folder provides solutions to Project Euler problems, in a variety of languages

## README Template

When you are adding a new folder for a new Project Euler problem, add a README.md in the folder with the following format:

```Markdown

# Project Euler Problem #***: Title of Problem

([Problem Link](<- Is Alt text. This is the ctual Link to  the problem))

Problem text copy/pasted exactly as it is from official website.
If there is center alignment, or formatting in the original question, then update as equivalent here.
