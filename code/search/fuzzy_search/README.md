# Fuzzy search
Also called as "Approximate string matching" is used to find strings matching a pattern.

# How it works
Commonly implemented as fuzzysearch(needle, haystack), returns true if "needle" is found in "haystack" depending on the approximation alogrithm used. Wikipedia can be good starting point to explore more on the topic.
