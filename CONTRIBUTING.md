The repo is organized into directories each with their own classification of problems.

Following is the high-level structure of cosmos:
* Backtracking	
* Bit manipulation
* Computational geometry
* Data structures
* Divide conquer
* Dynamic programming
* Graph algorithms
* Greedy algorithms
* Mathematical algorithms	
* Randomized algorithms	
* Search 
* Sorting	
* String algorithms
* Unclassified ðŸ‘»

Inside each, there will be folders with individual types of algorithms/data structures solved in different languages.
A folder may contain Python, Javascript, C++, Java, Golang etc. code all in the same folder.

## We welcome PRs!
