# Huffman encoding

Description
---
A Huffman code is an algorithm for lossless data compression based on the frequency of
occurrence of each letter, which was developed by David A. Huffman. Huffman encoding creates a tree,
assigns a binary code for each letter while traversing the tree. As a convention the left child of a
node takes the value of 0 and the right child the value of 1.
The most frequent a symbol is, the less bits are used to represent the specific symbol.
