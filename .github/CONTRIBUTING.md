# Cosmos

Welcome to the universe of algorithms and data structures. Before you begin contributing you must understand the concept of our organisation along with our goals and inspiration.
Read all about us [here](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/wiki)

## How to Begin

`“ Getting started is the most difficult thing to do; once you file it out, they rest of the journey is as soft as the straw. Be a good beginner. ” 
   ― Israelmore Ayivor`
 
 1. You can start contributing by selecting any field from our high-level structure that interests you the most.
 2. Once you have chosen the path, **make sure that the algorithm is not already implemented**. This step is very important because we dont't want your time and energy to be go in vain.
 3. When you complete step 2, read the [style guides](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/tree/master/guides/coding_style) for the language you want to implement. The coding style for every document is required to be similar so that it can be processed quickly and precisely across all platforms. 
 4. Last but not the least, follow our [code of conduct](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
 
 So what are you waiting for? Go on and start contributing! :smile: May the code be with you :metal:
