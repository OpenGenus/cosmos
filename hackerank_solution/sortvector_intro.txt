step1:
vector<int>v; (creates an empty vector of integers)//declaration of empty vector.

step2:
Size:
int size=v.size();

step3:
Pushing an integer into a vector:

v.push_back(x);(where x is an integer.The size increases by 1 after this.)

step4:
Popping the last element from the vector:

v.pop_back(); (After this the size decreases by 1)

step5:

Sorting a vector:

sort(v.begin(),v.end()); (Will sort all the elements in the vector)
