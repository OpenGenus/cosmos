# Cosmos
> The universe of algorithm and data structures

**Cosmos** is your personal offline collection of every algorithm and data structure one will ever encounter and use in a lifetime. This provides solutions in various languages spanning `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `Python`, `Go` and others.

This work is maintained by a community of hundreds of people and is a _massive collaborative effort_ to bring the readily available coding knowledge **offline**.

> **Many coders ask me how to improve their own performances. I cannot say anything except "solve and review and prepare your library"** - _Uwi Tenpen_

Each type has several hundreds of problems with solutions in several languages spanning `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `Python`, `Go` and others.

# Maintainers

This is a massive collaboration and to keep the quality intact and drive the vision in the proper direction, we have maintainers.

> Maintainers are your friends forever. They are vastly different from moderators.

The task of maintainers is to review pull requests, suggest further quality additions and keep the work up to date with the current state of the world. 🌍

[Check out our current maintainers](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/wiki/maintainers)

Let us know that you would like to be a maintainer in the Slack channel *#algorithms* and we will review and add you upon subsequent contributions. [Join us at Slack](http://slack.opengenus.org/).

# Contributions

The success of our vision to bring knowledge offline depends on you. Even a small contribution helps. All forms of contributions are highly welcomed and valued.

When you contribute, your name with a link (if available) is added to our [contributors list](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/wiki/contributors).

If contributing code, please refer to the available [style guides](/guides/coding_style).
