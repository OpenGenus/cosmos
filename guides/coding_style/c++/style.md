# C++ Style Guide

Code width and align
===
Try to limit code width to 100 number of columns.

To split lines as close to code width as possible of groupings (if a parameter is split, then all of parameters need split).

If width less than or equal to _code width_, then shold not split (unless split at return type), otherwise should split at comma.

Template definition should be split.

**Valid:**
```C++
// n <= 100 columns
bool operator==(container<T,Allocator> x, container<T,Allocator> y);

bool
operator==(container<T,Allocator> x, container<T,Allocator> y);

template<class T, class Allocator>
bool operator==(container<T,Allocator> x, container<T,Allocator> y);

template<class T, class Allocator>
bool
operator==(container<T,Allocator> x, container<T,Allocator> y);

// n > 100 columns
void cloneTwo(const container<T,Allocator>& x,
              const container<T,Allocator>& y,
              const container<T,Allocator>& z);

void
cloneTwo(const container<T,Allocator>& x,
         const container<T,Allocator>& y,
         const container<T,Allocator>& z);
```

Including Header Files
===
When including header files, only include files that are _portable_ across all compilers (Unless where applicable). Do not include `<bits/stdc++.h>`.

Comments
===
Single line comments should use the standard style (`//`), and multi line comments should use multiline comments (`/* */`). There should be a space between the comment delimiter and the comment text (unless pure-code synopsis).

**Valid:**
```C++
// Example text

/*
 *
 * Multiline comment
 *
 */
 
/*
 
 Simple multiline comment
 
 vector synopsis
 
template <class T, class Allocator = allocator<T> >
class vector
{
public:
    typedef T                                        value_type;
    typedef Allocator                                allocator_type;
}
*/
```

Macros
===
When naming macros, use uppercase for all the letters, and separate words by underscores.

**Valid:**
```C++
#define VALID
#define UPPERCASE_VALID
```

Variables
===
Local Variables
---
Local variables should be named using standard camel case.

**Valid:**
```C++
int name;
int camelCase;
```

Global Variables
---
Global variables should be named using prefix 'g\_' and standard camel case.

**Valid:**
```C++
int g_name;
int g_camelCase;
```

Constant Variables
---
Constant variables should be named using upper case and separate by underscore.

**Valid:**
```C++
int NAME;
int CONSTANT_NAME;
```

Braces
===
When using braces, put them on their own lines. For if statements and loops that have one line statements, omit the braces (unless between '}' and 'while' on do-while).

**Valid:**
```C++
int main()
{
    if (condition) 
    {
        statement;
        statement;
    }
    else if (condition)
    {
        statement;
        statement;
    }
    else
        statement;

    while (condition)
    {
        statement;
        statement;
    }

    for (;condition;)
       statement

    do
    {
        statement
    } while (condition);
}
```

On a side note, for conditionals and loops, put a space between the keyword and the opening parentheses, and another space after the closing parentheses.

When using class initialization with braces, then place a space after the opening brace, and before the closing brace.

```C++
ClassName objectName{ 1, 4 };
```

Functions
===
Functions should be named using standard camel case.
Names
---
**Valid:**
```C++
int name();
int camelCase();
```

Parameters
---
When listing POD (Plain Old Data) types, then pass them by value. When listing user-defined types, then pass them by const reference. When a function has to modify a variable, then, and only then pass the variable by reference.

**Valid:**
```C++
void exampleFunction(int pod, const Example& object, char& modifiableChar)
{
    // ...
}
```

Classes
===
Names
---
When naming classes, follow the rules of pascal case.

**Valid:**
```C++
class PascalCase;
struct PascalCase;
```

When naming the member variables of a class that shold be _private_, and add an underscore to the end of their name.

**Valid:**
```C++
class Example
{
    int name_;
    int camelCase_;
};
```

Order of Encapsulation
---
When listing members of a class, if possible (typedef/using maybe need primary define, but them still need respect following rules) list them in the order public, private, then protected.
Encapsulation labels should be indented to the same level as the class. Add a new line after the end of each label for readability.

**Valid:**
```C++
class Example
{
private:
    typedef int INT;

protected:
    using typename BaseClass::size_type;
    
public:
    // ...
    
private:
    // ...
    
protected:
    // ...
    
};
```

Order of Member Functions
---
When listing member functions of a class, first list the main constructor, then secondary constructors, and then copy assignment/copy construction/move assignment/move construction functions.
After this, add the destructor. Then, add a new line, and then list all members of the class.

* When possible, try to create a logical separation of member functions for clarity.
* If a class has all public members (not member functions), then use the `struct` keyword, otherwise use the `class` keyword.

**Valid:**
```C++
class Example
{
private:
    int value_;
    
public:
    Example() {  }
    Example(int value) { }
    Example(const Example& other) { }
    ~Example()
    
    void memberFunction();
    
};
```
