## Python Installation Guide for Linux

Most Linux Distros come pre-installed with python2, sometimes even python3. 

check by

```
python2 --version
```

if its not installed, install by

```
sudo dnf install python2
```

this also works

```
sudo apt-get install python2 
sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt-get install python ...<tab> to see your options
```
