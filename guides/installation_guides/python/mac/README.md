# Python Installation Guide

*How to install Python on your machine*

As with most Linux distributions, Python comes installed by default. Despite that, the installed version could be different with the one that you need or some packages may not be installed.

### Installing Python and the basic packages

From Python's organization webpage (<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python.org</a>) you can download the latest `.pkg` file. After that, just open the file and follow the instructions. This will also install the basic packages.

You can download it from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>.

### Installing additional packages

The easiest way to install a package is using the `pip` option in Terminal. If you are using Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 and installed it from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python.org</a> webpage, you already have it installed.

To install a package just open Terminal and type:

`pip install packageName`

Where `packageName` is the name of the package that you want to install. You can see the full list of available packages from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=browse">here</a>.
