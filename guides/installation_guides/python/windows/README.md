Installing Python on Windows is a simple process. Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ and choose the version you want to install. There are different installers based on your preferences: a web-based installer that downloads neccesary files during the installation and a full installer that contains all files. Run the installer and select options if you think that you need to, but the defaults are okay for most people.

Now that Python is installed, it is accessible through the program called IDLE.
