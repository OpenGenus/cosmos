# Cosmos Guide: Getting Ready to program in C++ in Windows
<b1> <b>Getting The Software</b> </b1> <br> <br>
>The easiest way for a beginner to start working on his first C++ program is to get an IDE. In this tutorial we are going to use CodeBlocks. <br>

>You can get Codeblocks from the Official Site: http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads <br>
>Click on <b>Download the binary release</b> <br>

>Look after codeblocks's <b>mingw-setup.exe</b>, it may be a different version than the one in the screenshot (16.01) but it does not matter. Click on the <b>SourceForge</b><br>

>After that you can just wait, and an installer should be downloaded. Follow all the steps, click on all the <b>Next</b>s, no custom non-default options are required. <br> <br>
Once Codeblocks has been installed, an <b>Autodetection Compiler</b> prompt should appear. Click <b>OK</b>. <br>
